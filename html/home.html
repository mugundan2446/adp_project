    <h3>ARCHITECTURE</h3>
    <p>
        The hotel is built in South Indian temple architecture and has four entrances similar to the temples in South India, accordingly named as 'Vallavan' (North), 'Sembiyan'(East), 'Killi' (South), and 'Chola' (West). There are 43 single bed room, 33 double bed room, and 2 triple bed room apartments. Other features similar to the temples include tall pillars, grand columns, and sweeping staircases.

        The white and soft-cream floral motifs in close clusters in the hotel, found on the walls, ceilings, and pillars, such as the sunflower motif in the portico and the kolam-inspired motifs in the food and beverage areas, are themed after the Chola empire, which ruled parts of South India and South-East Asia from 300 BCE to 1250 CE.The bronze horse in front of the lobby is based on the one that was yoked to the chariots of the Chola kings.The marble walls are interspersed with panels of carvings of the wheel of life, the four-petalled flower, and are echoed in the etchings on the glass doors leading to the rooms and lounge area.[18]
        
        The architectural theme is reinforced with 462 pillars,most of them with hand-carved design work inspired by the Brihadeeshwara temple of Tanjore.The hotel has over 1 million square feet of marble with 57 varieties of the stone,for which the company bought a marble quarry in whole in Italy and shipped several tonnes of the stone to Chennai for the construction.The hotel has 7 lounges, and the average room size is 625 sq ft.The intricate stonework in the building were created by 4,000 artisans from Mamallapuram who worked on site.The overall construction of the hotel took five years to complete.

    <h3>GREEN FEATURE</h3>
    <p>
        The hotel avoided cutting down trees at the property ever since the pre-construction phase by transplanting all the existing trees around the hotel. Of the building material value of the hotel project, over 10 percent is composed of recycled raw materials, over 40 percent is composed of materials manufactured and/or extracted within a radius of 800 km, and over 5 percent is made of plant products that are typically harvested with a 10-year span or shorter. During construction of the hotel complex, about 17 percent of Portland cement by weight was replaced by flyash. Over 50 percent of the wood products used in the construction of the hotel are from Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)–certified forests.[16]

        With its own solar and wind farms,the whole of the hotel's energy requirements are met through renewable sources, including waste water.The hotel saves over 40 percent of energy by means of various energy efficiency features.A 12.6-MW windmill caters to the power requirement of the hotel complex, the excess of which is contributed to the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board.[17] The heating, ventilation and air conditioning in the complex are optimally controlled using a technology known as Hartman Loop.[16] The envelope materials of the building comprising composite wall assembly, multi-glazed windows, and roof-top insulation, well exceed the fenestration standards of ASHRAE/ECBC.The roof is a combination of green roof, and the reflective paints and high SRI finish on the domes of the complex reduce thermal gradient differences after daylight hours.The hotel also has independent, programmable lighting controls installed in each area. Water is heated by means of solar concentrators. The hotel uses water-cooled refrigerants in place of air-cooled ones. Energy is saved by means of a jet fan ventilation system.
